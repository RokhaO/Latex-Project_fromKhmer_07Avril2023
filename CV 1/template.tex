%	 ABOUT ME
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\aboutme{}%My name is Soum Som on, I am still a student, who has not finished bachelor degree from Institute of Technology of Cambodia (ITC) in the department Information and Technology Engineering yet. I had skipped my study since I was in the end of year 4 in order that I could find my passion and the way to reach my goals faster than this. I have noted that when I was at school I did not learn much about what I wanted even I have learned a lot about IT skill both theory and practice. For theory, I have learned HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, MySQL, PHP, Algorithms, C, and Java Programming. Anyway, I want to follow my dreams that's why I decided to skip my study for a while to learn something that help me more than this. } % To have no About Me section, just remove all the text and leave \aboutme{}

%\section{Other information}

%\subsection{Review}

%Alice approaches Wonderland as an anthropologist, but maintains a strong sense of noblesse oblige that comes with her class status. She has confidence in her social position, education, and the Victorian virtue of good manners. Alice has a feeling of entitlement, particularly when comparing herself to Mabel, whom she declares has a ``poky little house," and no toys. Additionally, she flaunts her limited information base with anyone who will listen and becomes increasingly obsessed with the importance of good manners as she deals with the rude creatures of Wonderland. Alice maintains a superior attitude and behaves with solicitous indulgence toward those she believes are less privileged.
